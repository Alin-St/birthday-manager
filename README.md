## Client Idea:

Mobile Application Idea - Birthday Manager:
An application that helps you manage birthdays. The application should allow you to create, read, update and delete birthdays. Each birthday contains the date, a name (it's intended to put the name of the birthday person here), the birthdate year (used to compute age), additional details (text field for present preferences and other details), a checkbox used for close family and friends. Only the name and date are mandatory to complete, the year and additional details are optional. The application should save the data to a remote server. When a birthday is due and also 7 days before, the application should send a notification to the phone. Birthdays should be visible on the main page. They should always be ordered in the same order they occur in the year, starting with Jan 1st. There should be an option to filter the data, to keep only family members and close friends visible. If the birthdate year is specified, the age the birthday person turns into should be shown whenever possible, along with the rest of the details.
Example of a notification: "Birthday Manager: [Name] will turn [current age + 1] in 7 days!"
